Predicting Weekly Sales of Walmart Stores using Historical Walmart Dataset

The Walmart historical markdown dataset is used.

Objective:
One challenge of modeling retail data is the need to make decisions based on limited history. If Christmas comes but once a year, so does the chance to see how strategic decisions impacted the bottom line.

Dataset and Challenges:
Historical sales data for 45 Walmart stores located in different regions. Each store contains many departments, and the requirement is to project the sales for each department in each store. To add to the challenge, selected holiday markdown events are included in the dataset. These markdowns are known to affect sales, but it is challenging to predict which departments are affected and the extent of the impact.

The various excel files ccontaining imtermediate analysis data are created along the way.

Finally, the output file is created in the desired format using the random forest regression method which gives lowest RMSE of all model tested and analysed.
